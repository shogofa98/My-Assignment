       <h1>Afghni Clothes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The designs are new, beautiful, unique, and part of the best representatives of Afghan traditional attire. The quality of work is unmatchable with a price that beats any competitive market</li>
            <li>Traditional Afghan clothing for men and women often consists of long dresses and trousers, adorned with intricate embroidery and design. During the Taliban regime, women were required to wear a specific type of dress and head covering, while men were limited in the types of clothing they could wear</li>
            <li>In Afghanistan, cotton and wool have remained the dominant fabrics used for dressing; however, for preparing the expensive dresses, rugs and carpets, silk was also an important raw material</li>
